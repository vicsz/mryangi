        <p>
            The YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It) principle aims to drive home the importance of delivering value instead of over-engineering, resume driven development, and unneeded functionality. Code is not an asset, it's a liability. The more you write, the more you'll have to maintain later.
        </p>
        <p>
            While everyone wants flexible software, flexibility usually comes at a cost. Configurable software may seem like a cheaper solution, but it's often better to focus on delivering high-value functionality with minimal configuration. Add configuration options later when necessary. However, don't make decisions now that will hamper future growth. Adding flexibility now and getting it wrong can make it harder to evolve in the future and may delay deployment, thus delaying the benefit.
        </p>
        <p>
            Don't try to separate the layers into discrete processes unless absolutely necessary. Doing so will degrade performance and add complexity. Instead, focus on what you actually need at the moment, without trying to predict the future.
        </p>
        <p>
            Avoid reinventing the wheel. If a perfectly good solution exists, like a protocol or a major library, use it. Don't spend time working on something that's already been done when you could be working on your software. Strive for efficiency, not perfection. It's more important to get the job done than to chase that extra 20% that has little real impact on the overall performance.
        </p>
        <p>
            Remember, we don't need to be ruthless to save costs, but why build the luxury model when the Chevy would do just as well? Embrace the YAGNI principle and focus on delivering value, not unnecessary complexity.
