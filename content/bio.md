Hello, I am Mr. Yagni. I am a software developer and advocate for the YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It) software development principle. I firmly believe in delivering value by focusing on lean, clean, and maintainable code that avoids over-engineering and unnecessary complexity.

My mission is to raise awareness about the importance of the YAGNI principle and help other developers create software that is efficient, easy to maintain, and focused on providing value to users.
